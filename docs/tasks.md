## How to define a good task

As a team member, you want to progress quickly, so you are motivated to define tasks which are both:

* easy to understand;
* easy to solve and evaluate.

Here at Fort Major we're all about efficiency and self-management.
Which means that most of the time you would create tasks, which you're going to solve by yourself. And while it's tempting to define those tasks "your way", **don't do that**.

First of all, a clearly defined task (goal) will make your own work simpler and faster.
Second, we are a DAO and we value transparency. Tasks are public (even drafts) so any other contributor (or even some walking by stranger) should be able to understand the work we're doing here.
Third, your work is evaluated with reputation, which ...

### Title

The title should clearly reflect what is the goal of this task - what should be the solution for it. It should express the goal fully, but be concise at the same time.

`good` - Post a creative tweet about MSQ's new "Payments" feature
`bad`  - Promote MSQ
`bad`  - Promote MSQ by posting a non-trivial tweet about MSQ's new "Payments" feature which is how MSQ is similar to Stripe

Sometimes, it is a good idea to also add **hints** to the title, which would quickly give a better understanding of the thematics of the task and what skills does a solver need to solve it. **Hints** are given in square brackets before the title. But don't overdo it, please. Examples:

* [MSQ] [Twitter] Make a creative post about the "Payments" feature
* [MSQ] [Backend] Fix incorrectly calculated fees
* [FMJ] [Graphics Design] Create a set of vector illustrations
* [FMJ] [Important Details Inside] Plan the next sprint (04/12/24 - 28/12/24)

### Tags

Tags are super-important! It is crucial to set the tags of a task correctly, because voting power delegation works based on presence of particular tags in the task.

Currently there are 6 tags:

* `Governance`
* `Development`
* `Marketing`
* `Design`
* `Documentation`
* `Testing`

You can attach any subset of tags to a task, but a if you need more than one it is a good sign that your task is too broad and you better consider splitting it into multiple tasks.
